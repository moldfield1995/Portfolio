            Two weeks before Steam winter sale was going to go live we were asked to come up with some ideas for a winter patch then implement, test and release it the day before the winter sale.<br />
            <br />
            This mostly consisted of us creating additional content on the current work frame. This involved creating a new game mode as well as a new map. Some optimizations were also made as well as completion of some weapons that were in the game but hadnâ€™t been completed.<br />
            <br />
            For this task I was responsible for fixing bugs that we found in playtesting, finishing the implementations of the weapons, optimizing areas of the game where possible and doing the final build and testing.
