            This is my current group project game that we are developing. There are 3 programmers including myself and 4 designers.<br/>
            <br/>
            This project initially started in Unreal with the intension of designers implementing animation, VFX and doing the shader work. This worked fine but we found Unrealâ€™s Units would sometimes fly of the screen or sometimes be unresponsive. We switched to Unity as the programmers where a lot more familiar and had most of the features we had in unreal implemented within a week.<br/>
            <br/>
            We are currently approaching beta and have greatly improved the feel of the unit control, the UI and the overall look of the game.
