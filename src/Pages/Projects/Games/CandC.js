            This was a game that we are developed during our final year for our group project. There are 3 programmers including myself and 4 designers.<br/>
            <br/>
            This project initially started in Unreal with the intension of designers implementing animation, VFX and doing the shader work. This worked fine but we found Unrealâ€™s Units would sometimes fly of the screen or sometimes be unresponsive. We switched to Unity as the programmers where a lot more familiar and had most of the features we had in unreal implemented within a week.<br/>
            <br/>
            My part of the games development was implementing the fog of war, that I user a vertex shader to implement the variation in size and position, the building interaction and UI, and the mining mechanics.
