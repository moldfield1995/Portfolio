            Social Sender is a social media scheduler and automation app that give and suggests content that are in the categories that are selected, then allow you to customize it or create your own.<br />
            <br />
            This is version two of the app (Originally called SMART), that was built fully in .net framework with an API, ASP Web App, Xamarin mobile app, and the automation being a windows console app that ran asside the API. This was one of my first project and a lot was learnt from its development <br />
            <br />
            Social Sender was a fresh start using .net core and a React PWA web app. My part in the project was mostly on the back end handling the API and automation side of the app, integrating with Facebook via their Rest API, Twitter with a third party package Tweetinvi, and resonantly with LinkedIn&apos;s Rest API  <br />
            <br />
            On the front end I did the admin portal for managing content and implementing the CRON paten generator allowing admins and users to flexibly schedule content<br />
