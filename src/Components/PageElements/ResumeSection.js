            I started with Torchbearer after completing my 4-year Computer games programming course.
            I joined Torchbearer with minimal web development skills with only building static HTML sites,
            and quickly found my place in the team developing the back ends for our websites.
            At Torchbearer I developed several websites with the team, but with more projects being developed in I started doing the front-end development as well.
            All the web projects above were developed with torchbearer, with many of the APIs and database schema being done by myself.

            I was offered a placement in the university in house studio, Canalside.
            As a member of a team of four programmers my role was to release a
            full product by the end of the year. I also took part in open days and
            worked alongside the university for applicant visits giving talks about
            the studioâ€™s history and current projects. I was responsible for
            implementing or tweaking features, and oversaw Git
            management, minor tech support, marketing for our game and
            attending events on behalf of the studio. We released <Link href="/Flux8" color="secondary">Flux8</Link> in August
            and worked on internal projects such as a dungeon defence game for
            mobile, and a <Link href="/Vrrrr" color="secondary">pirate VR golf game</Link>.
